    <h3>Physical Abilities
        Enhanced Strength: Zenitsu has attained amazing physical strength through years of harsh training. Zenitsu can hold down Inosuke Hashibira with his bare hands and throw his entire body by grabbing to and swinging one of his legs.[11] Most importantly, Zenitsu has incredible leg strength allowing him to jump extremely high and move at blistering speeds to perform his Thunder Breathing techniques. He was also able to damage the body of Muzan, whose body has the highest durability out of all the demons, further testifying his incredible physical strength.

        Immense Speed & Reflexes: Zenitsu is extremely fast, being able to easily move faster than even the eye can see. Even during the beginning of his career as a Demon Slayer, it is plainly obvious that his speed far outclassed that of lesser demons such as the Tongue Demon and Son of the Spider Family. During both skirmishes, neither demon was able to hit Zenitsu when he was actively engaged with the battle and both were completely unable to react to the speed of his attacks. During the battle against Enmu, he was able to save Nezuko from Lower Rank One's flesh appendages and could slice through many of them before Enmu could react.
        
        As he progresses, his speed has improved to the point that his movements couldn't be perceived by Upper Rank demons, like Daki and Kaigaku, the former's reflexes having been amplified multiple times during the fight and latter being a user of the same Breathing Style as Zenitsu. Moreover, Zenitsu could move faster than Kaigaku's lightning-based Blood Demon Art and cut his neck before the attack reached him. Most impressively, Zenitsu could land multiple hits on the imperceptibly fast Demon King, Muzan Kibutsuji, with his techniques, albeit he was severely weakened then.
        
        Immense Stamina & Endurance: Zenitsu has incredible stamina and endurance. He has been shown to continue fighting even after being affected by lethal poison from the Son Spider Demon that was gradually weakening him and turning him into a spider. He was also able to defend 3 train cars with Nezuko for an extended period of time without tiring out. Later, Zenitsu, along with Inosuke, engaged in combat with Upper Rank Six, Daki, for an extended long period of time. Even after receiving numerous wounds from the Upper Rank and later getting trapped under rubble, Zenitsu had enough stamina left to unleash his Thunderclap and Flash: Godspeed technique twice; once to get out of the rubble and the second time to blitz Daki.
        
        He was able to continue fighting with Kaigaku even after being on the receiving end of multiple Blood Demon Art-enhanced Thunder Breathing techniques that burned his skin and eventually summon enough power to use his ultimate technique and blitz him. Zenitsu was even able to exert himself for around half an hour during the fight against Muzan, even being able to surpass his limit of only being able to use his Thunderclap and Flash: Godspeed technique twice a day before his legs gave out.</h3>
