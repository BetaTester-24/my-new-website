    <h3>Overall Abilities
        Zenitsu using Thunderclap and Flash on Tongue Demon
        Zenitsu decapitates a demon instantly.
        
        From the beginning, Zenitsu comes off as a talented and skilled Demon Slayer though he denies this. His strength awakens when he is asleep as his nervous demeanour is what normally keeps him from accessing his abilities, making him more sagacious, calm and precise in combat. This allowed him to instantly decapitate the Tongue Demon and defeat Son of the Spider Family by himself. He was later able to defend 3 entire train carts being under attack by Enmu, Lower Rank One, along with Nezuko. A few months after that, he was able to go toe-to-toe with an awakened Daki with the assistance of Inosuke, and later managed to blitz her with Thunderclap and Flash: Godspeed. As further credence to his strength, Zenitsu was able to advance to the highest point of the Hashira Training.

        Zenitsu singlehandedly killing an Upper Rank demon.
        
        However, the greatest extent of his powers manifests when Zenitsu fights while awake, as he managed to outmatch the new Upper Rank Six, Kaigaku, in speed by himself and was later blitzed and decapitated him before he could react, although he sustained several severe injuries. Moreover, Zenitsu's initial reluctance to kill Kaigaku, someone he once cared about and looked up to, was the only thing that gave the Upper Rank the initial advantage, hinting that he could have simply killed him from the beginning if he so desired. Later on, he could keep up with and battle the Demon King, Muzan Kibutsuji, albeit while severely weakened by the Anti-Kibutsuji Drug. Nonetheless, Zenitsu's strength more than likely matched that of the Hashira by the end of the series.
        
        Zenitsu refusing to let Inosuke harm Nezuko
        Zenitsu's indomitable willpower.
        
        Indomitable Will: In spite of his initial cowardice and reluctance to fight, Zenitsu nonetheless possesses indomitable willpower and spirit. This was displayed when he absolutely refused to let Inosuke kill the demon inside Tanjiro's box, and protected it to the end despite getting relentlessly beat up by Inosuke. While he was asleep against the battle against Daki, Zenitsu had the willpower to continue fighting despite sustaining numerous slash wounds all over his body and having his feet broken.[10] Through sheer will and anger, Zenitsu was able to overcome his cowardice and stay awake in battle against demons, shown during his bout with Kaigaku and Muzan, especially in the fight with the latter in which he refused to give up and persisted despite being enervated and injured.
        
        Tactical Intellect: Even when fighting unconscious, Zenitsu has displayed incredible judgement and tactical intellect. When fighting consciously, this ability is fully released. This able was best exhibited during his battle against Upper Rank Six, Daki. When Inosuke made an erroneous deduction of her weaknesses, Zenitsu correctly explicated that all they need to do is keep both demons' head disconnected to kill them. After his bout with Kaigaku commenced, he was able to clearly think and process his techniques and demonic abilities.
        
        Unconscious Combat: Zenitsu has the ability to fight when he sleeps, which allows him to awaken his true strength. While awake, his nerves and fear cause him to freeze up so he cannot move. When his life is in danger, his nerves and fear grow so strong that he passes out. But while asleep, his nerves are no longer holding him back, allowing him to fight and move with great judgement, precision and skill. His hearing also places a big part in allowing Zenitsu to fight unconsciously, as it enables him to discern his surroundings and the location of his enemies and their attacks. This also allows him to fight even after he falls victim to Enmu's spell that makes anyone go into deep sleep.</h3>
